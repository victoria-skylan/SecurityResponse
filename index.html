                    <p>
                        On November 1st one of our servers was hacked because of an internet connection left open. This connection was not supposed to be open and the details about how it was is still under examination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to this open port an attacker was able to get into our system and retrieve customer data. That data includes customers' names, addresses, and, depending on if a customer has an account with us, emails and passwords.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note, all passwords were encrypted before the attack, so it is highly unlikely that the attacker will discern any actual viable passwords.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The hacker also either froze or deleted two of our databases that deal with customer transactions. However, that information is internal to our business and will only affect our valuable customers in terms of recent purchase history visibility. Because of the edits by the hacker, we lost our transaction history for the past two weeks. We will still honor our full return/exchange policy. See the details in our <a href="#solution">Solution</a> report for more information on our efforts to compensate our customers for this failure of trust.
                    </p>

                    <p>We believe that the attacker was an upset customer who wanted to create havoc on this company due to an unfortunate accident.
                    <span class="text-primary">
                        Please know that we care about all of our customers and their saftey. If an event has occured that has created any type of problem for you and your family

                        <p>Even though we can’t access the administrator user, we can still shut them off, and Reset them. If this isn’t the case, and we can’t reset them, then we will have to buy two new servers. Or just go to AWS. It might be the perfect opportunity.</p>

                        <p>We will be able to reset the passwords and reconfigure ssh keys to ensure that there is nothing left behind from the hacker. This will also lock him out.</p>

                        <br><h6>Reason</h6>
                        <p>This will give IT 1 week to reset and reconfigure the servers. While they do this Dev will spend the week updating the old version of the website in order to fix any bugs and security issues so that it can be launched once the servers are running.

                    <p> There are no <a href=”http://www.shorturl.at/fzEGP”>federal regulations</a> that clearly specify a nationwide deadline for informing individuals or regulatory bodies of a data breach.

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Businesses are to inform Utah residents of a data breach involving personal information if, after a reasonable and prompt investigation, it is determined that the personal information stolen will be used for identity theft or fraud. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We have reason to suspect that the hacker may potentially use the personal and order information to phish company executives, posing as legitimate customers, and therefore this stipulation is met by current circumstances, although it is unlikely this form of ‘identity theft’ will have any adverse or noticeable effect on the customer whose identity is assumed by the hacker. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No deadline is given to disclose information about the breach, other than it is should be conducted as quickly as possible, assuming it will not interfere with the needs of law enforcement, the scope of the breach has been determined, and the system has been restored to reasonable integrity.

                        <li>
                            Individuals may be informed through first-class mail to the most recent address on file for that individual (not necessarily the best solution given address in the database are not necessarily the customer’s place of residence) or electronically if that is the business’s primary method of communication with the customer (which it is presumed to be for Outdoor Depot)

                    <h6 class="text-muted"><i>Federal Trade Commission</i></h6>
                    <p>The FTC can potentially file a suit against Outdoor Depot if they rule that there has been substantial customer injury, the benefits offered to consumers did not provide sufficient recompense for the injuries sustained, and the consumers could not have avoided the injury.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <b>The FTC files an action for a security breach in the following areas
                        </b>
                            <li>
                            Breach of highly sensitive personal information
                        </li>
                        <li>Breach of payment card information</li>
                        <li>Violation of privacy policies</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>To the best of our knowledge, no actions on behalf of the company violated our privacy policies, and no payment card information was stored. The only personal identifiers stored are names, emails (only for customers with accounts), and shipping address, which typically is not viewed as highly sensitive personal information (examples of highly sensitive information are social security numbers or medical information). We, therefore, feel that it is unlikely the FTC will open a case against Outdoor Depot.</p>

                    <p>The SEC Cyber Unit was formed in 2017 and focuses on detecting and addressing cyber-based misconduct. They typically concern themselves with issues such as market manipulation through social media, violations of distributed ledger technology, unauthorized access to brokerage accounts, and threats to critical cyberinfrastructure.</p>
                    <p>hey have occasionally concerned themselves with instances of an external hacker seeking to obtain and either leverage or publicize private information, but we were unable to find any relevant examples of the commission responding to an insider threat. We feel it is unlikely they will pursue a case against Outdoor Depot</p>
                    <h5 class="text-success">Individual Lawsuit Prerequisites</h5>
                    <p>Any individual affected by the breach has a constitutional right to bring a suit against the company. In order for the suit to be considered valid, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury that is traceable to them. This injury must not be hypothetical but must have actually occurred or deemed by a court to occur imminently (an injury-in-fact).</p>
                    <p>Plaintiffs in security breach cases are typically suing for reimbursement on behalf of lost resources, such as the cost of replacing a credit card, damage to credit or reputation, fees for monitoring and protecting personal information following a breach, etc.</p>
                    <p>We believe that due to the nature of the breach and the limited quantity of potentially sensitive information that was lost, there are not likely to be many plaintiffs, and only a portion of those will have a strong case against Outdoor Depot. However, to minimize the legal cases brought against the company even further, the legal team has put together an alternative settlement to offer customers as reconciliation for injuries suffered. This settlement would be taken on the condition that customers agree not to pursue a lawsuit against Outdoor Depot.</p>
                    <h5 class="text-success">Alternative Settlement Process</h5>
                    <p>Suits took against the company not only have the potential to damage the company’s public image and financial holdings, but also typically do not result in the plaintiffs acquiring any meaningful amount of fiscal recompense, and frequently do not reach a resolution for months or even years. It is recommended that the company acknowledge the individual’s right to take any legal action they feel is justified, but also provide an alternative route to those customers who would be open to a more immediate method for securing comparable financial restitution. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <b>A recommendation is made to publicly offer a settlement to all customers whose information had been compromised. Said process would be conducted as follows:
                        </b>
                        <li>Potential claimants could search to see if their name or email address is found within the bank of compromised data (this search function could be hosted on a webpage hosted on the domain typically occupied by the point-of-sales website’s landing page)</li>
                        <li>Customers who find that their information is suspected to be comprised then have the option of receiving a $100 voucher, good at all company storefronts and online
                        </li>
                        <li>Customers who choose to pursue this option are first required to digitally sign an agreement stating that they will not take any legal action against the company with regard to this data breach (but does not bar them from pursuing suits involving past or future grievances)
                        </li>
                        <li>Upon signing, the voucher is sent to the compromised email address (so as to prevent any identity fraud from any customers seeking multiple vouchers)
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="text-primary">We feel this process will not only have a smaller impact on revenue than absorbing legal fees but will also minimize the number of lawsuits, both class and action, and individual, that may be brought against the company.

                    <h4 class="response-header text-center">Legal Defense</h4>
                    <p class = "m-2"> We believe that both the circumstances under which the breach occurred, and the company’s reaction to it, provide the basis for a strong legal case, and our defense will be based on the three following arguments:
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="text-info">First, it is virtually impossible to guard against the machinations of the malicious insider.</h6>
                    <p class = "m-2">Employees, by virtue of their membership within a company, are held in a position of trust. They are presumed to have the company’s well-being as a priority, or at the very least, to intend no harm to their place of employment. This is a logical assumption, as harm to the company equates to harm to the employees.</p>
                    <p class = "m-2">So it is understandable that an employee would be trusted with certain access and configuration permissions relevant to their position within the company. In particular in the case of an employee who manages a low-risk, low traffic server, it is not really any wonder that they were given the autonomy to make decisions regarding the status of that server, which included the choice to establish a connection to the internet.</p>
                    <p class = "m-2">There are those who would argue that safeguards could have been put in place to ensure that other individuals within the company needed to sign off on such decisions before they could be enacted, but what is to stop the employee with malignant intentions from concocting an urgent, compelling falsehood to procure permissions from other company personnel? And even if such approval processes were to be used, how could companies ever be expected to construct a comprehensive list of actions that require permission from a higher-up to execute, let alone the potential for process inefficiency and lost time as a barrage of authorization requests continually slogs its way through the company bureaucracy. Such an approach is arguably no better than having no permission granting process, as the managers would incur so much decision fatigue from reviewing and approving constant requests that they would be unlikely to notice any suspicious indicators if they encountered a malicious request.</p>
                    <p class = "m-2">We believe that every company has a responsibility to shore up their customers’ information as best as possible from any onslaughts of malicious external forces, as well as to train their own personnel in best security practices so as to ensure that no well-intentioned employee is unwittingly the perpetrator of a company’s data breach. But there is no reasonable process nor precautions that can be put in place to sabotage the workings of every malicious insider with means and motive, and no company should be punished for not being able to foresee and circumvent the deliberate, destructive actions of an individual who is reasonably assumed to be an ally to the company.  </p>
                    <h6 class="text-info"> Second, the company in question stored little sensitive information, and sensitive information that was stored was encrypted.</h6>
                    <p class = "m-2">The company in question took reasonable precautions to ensure that even in the event of a breach, there was minimal sensitive data that a hacker could exploit.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "m-2">For example, any credit card information was handled by a PCI compliant third party. Additionally, no checking account or bank account information is stored from individuals who choose to make cash payments. Customers are not required to register an email or password in order to use the company’s website.</p>
                    <p class = "m-2">For those who do choose to make an account, their password is hashed (presumably with the MD5 hash, as that is what is used internally) and not stored in plaintext.</p>
                    <p class = "m-2">The only other potentially sensitive information that the hacker could have potentially gained is the addresses orders where shipped to, which is not necessarily the customer’s place of residence.</p>
                    <p class = "m-2">No other personally identifying information was asked for, including date of birth, phone number, residential address, or billing address, despite the inclusion of these personal identifiers as required data points for account creation on many other commercial sites.</P>
                    <p  class = "m-2">It is our belief that the company not only ensured that no sensitive data was stored unnecessarily on the site, but also took reasonable measures to protect what sensitive information they did store, and went beyond that to then expeditiously encourage customers to change their password both on their own site, and anywhere else where they may have duplicate use of that password.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="text-info">Finally, upon learning of the breach, the company quickly and accurately informed their client base and looked to their well being not only on their own site but in general practice.</h6>
                    <p class = "m-2">Rather than choosing to postpone disclosure of the breach to its clients, which is within the company’s legal rights, decision-makers within the company chose to quickly inform their clients that their data had potentially been compromised. This was not a self-serving gesture on the company’s behalf. Rather, it was an effort to continue conducting company affairs in an ethical, trustworthy way. Even though they were under no legal obligation to disclose any information about the breach so rapidly, they considered the needs of their clients, and what they as individuals would want and expect in terms of a data breach notification.</p>
                    <p class = "m-2">But not only did they strive to keep their clients informed of the situation and protect them from further injury on their own site by requiring them to change their password, but they also then made the recommendation to their clients to change their passwords on any other sites where the same password is used. This is addressing the extremely pervasive and inherently insecure practice of reusing passwords. Whether the company itself can be held liable for a compromised password on their site being used to then exploit email accounts, bank accounts, or other personal accounts is something of a grey area, but the leaders at Outdoor Depot determined that, liable or not, they wanted to protect their customers from further harm.</p>
                    <h6 class="text-info">In conclusion</h6>
                    <p class = "m-2"> we believe that the company in question has not violated any regulations in terms of secure storage of customer data, and they took every reasonable precaution against outsider threats and even non-malicious insider threats. The data breach, while regrettable, does not yield itself to any infallible prevention measures, as there is no infallible way to guard against a malicious insider. Despite the company as an entity not being at fault for the actions of one disgruntled employee, they still rapidly took initiative to inform and protect their clients to the best of their abilities, both in regard to their business and other businesses their customers patronize. These are the actions of a company that upholds the law and the principles it embodies, and we find the company not guilty of any acts of negligence or mismanagement.
